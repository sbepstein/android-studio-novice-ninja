# AndroidStudioIntro
An engaging way to learn Android Studio.

Please, do not try to compile this project. It's structured to show you how to use Android Studio. 
Take a look at the class Agenda. Initially, the shortcuts are for the Mac, I hope to add those for Windows (which I sorely miss, mostly the simplified shortcuts).
