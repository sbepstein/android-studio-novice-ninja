# From Novice to Ninja
An engaging way to learn Android Studio.

This project isn't intended to be run, you can compile it and just start by looking at [Agenda] (android-studio-novice-ninja/app/src/main/java/com/android/ninja/Agenda.java).

The comments inside every class are intended to be your guide. IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio are gentle beasts, unlike other IDE's, they won't get in your way but you will be amazed at the insane number of features they both offer.
